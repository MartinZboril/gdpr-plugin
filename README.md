## Settings

### Cookies groups

The main idea is to create groups of cookies and scripts you want to run on your website.

One or more groups can be set as `Required`. User cannot disable these groups in Manage cookies component.

One or more groups can be set as `Active without consent`. Scripts in these groups will always run.

### Cookies bar 

You can edit title and content of cookies bar.

If you want, you can allow default CSS styles.

#### Buttons

You can add one or more buttons to your cookies bar. 

One (or more) buttons can be set to `Allow all cookies`. Clicking on these buttons will set all cookies groups to be enabled.

> *Users can change cookies settings later on CMS page with Manage cookies component (like /gdpr).*

One (or more) buttons can be set to `Open modal window` (currently supported only for Bootstrap UI style when set on Settings tab).

### Manage cookies

Just add title and content and those will be shown above cookies groups listing in Manage cookies component.


### Settings

Few general settings to be set.

#### Cookies expiration

Number of days for cookies to live in browser.

#### UI style

Change formating of output HTML code.

### Import

You can import settings presets from default files or your own.

You have to use YAML format.

Examples are in `/plugins/janvince/smallgdpr/assets/presets/` folder.


## Components

### Cookies bar

Should be used in your Layouts.


### Manage cookies

Put this component to your page with details about privacy (like /gdpr or /cookies).

Users will be able to change cookies settings.
